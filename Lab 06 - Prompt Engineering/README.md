### Theoretical Concepts for reference

**What is Prompt Engineering?**
Prompt Engineering involves the careful design of instructions (prompts) that guide AI model behavior to produce desired outputs. This includes word choice, information structuring, context provision, and output format definition.

**Why is it Important?**
- **Accuracy**: Well-crafted prompts produce more precise results
- **Consistency**: Structured techniques ensure predictable outputs
- **Efficiency**: Reduces the need for multiple attempts
- **Control**: Provides greater control over style and output format

**Components of a Good Prompt:**
1. **Context**: Relevant background information
2. **Instruction**: Clear description of the desired task
3. **Examples**: Demonstrations of expected format (when applicable)
4. **Constraints**: Specific guidelines or restrictions
5. **Output Format**: How the response should be structured

### 1. Zero-Shot Prompting
Learn to create effective prompts without providing examples, using only clear and specific instructions to guide the model.

**Characteristics:**
- No prior examples required
- Relies on model's pre-trained knowledge
- Simple to implement
- May not be effective for complex or specific tasks

**When to Use:**
- Simple, well-defined tasks
- When you don't have examples available
- For initial testing of model capabilities

### 2. Few-Shot Prompting
Explore how providing 2-5 examples in the prompt can significantly improve the quality and consistency of model responses.

**Characteristics:**
- Includes 2-5 demonstration examples
- Improves accuracy compared to zero-shot
- Helps model understand desired output format
- Effective for tasks that follow specific patterns

**When to Use:**
- Tasks requiring specific format
- When zero-shot doesn't provide adequate results
- For classification or structured tasks

### 3. Chain-of-Thought Prompting
Discover how to encourage the model to show its step-by-step reasoning, resulting in more logical and well-founded responses.

**Characteristics:**
- Encourages explicit reasoning steps
- Improves performance on complex reasoning tasks
- Makes model's thinking process transparent
- Particularly effective for mathematical and logical problems

**When to Use:**
- Complex reasoning tasks
- Mathematical problems
- Multi-step processes
- When you need to verify the reasoning

### 4. Meta Prompting
Understand how to create prompts that instruct the model on how to approach different types of tasks more efficiently.

**Characteristics:**
- Provides instructions about how to think about the task
- Establishes frameworks for problem-solving
- Creates reusable approaches for similar tasks
- Improves consistency across different scenarios

**When to Use:**
- Complex, open-ended tasks
- When you want to establish a consistent approach
- For tasks requiring specific methodology

### 5. Prompt Chaining
Learn to divide complex tasks into a sequence of simpler and more focused prompts.

**Characteristics:**
- Breaks complex tasks into manageable steps
- Each step builds on the previous one
- Allows for intermediate validation
- Reduces errors in complex workflows

**When to Use:**
- Very complex tasks
- Multi-stage processes
- When you need intermediate outputs
- For quality control at each step

### 6. Tree of Thoughts (ToT)
Explore an advanced technique that allows the model to consider multiple lines of reasoning simultaneously.

**Characteristics:**
- Explores multiple reasoning paths
- Allows backtracking and alternative approaches
- More thorough exploration of solution space
- Requires more computational resources

**When to Use:**
- Creative problem-solving
- When multiple valid approaches exist
- Complex decision-making scenarios

### 7. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
Understand how to combine external information with prompts to generate more accurate and up-to-date responses.

**Characteristics:**
- Incorporates external knowledge sources
- Provides current, specific information
- Reduces hallucinations
- Enables knowledge grounding

**When to Use:**
- Tasks requiring current information
- Domain-specific knowledge
- Factual accuracy is critical

### 8. Active-Prompt
Discover techniques for creating prompts that adapt dynamically based on context and feedback.

**Characteristics:**
- Adapts based on context or previous responses
- Incorporates feedback loops
- Self-improving over time
- More sophisticated prompt management

**When to Use:**
- Interactive applications
- When context changes dynamically
- For personalized responses

### Best Practices and Guidelines

**Fundamental Principles:**

1. **Be Specific and Clear**: Leave as little as possible to interpretation. Restrict the operational space clearly.

2. **Use Descriptive Language**: Employ analogies and clear descriptions to make instructions more understandable.

3. **Reinforce Important Instructions**: Repeat critical information before and after your main content when necessary.

4. **Consider Order and Structure**: The sequence of information can significantly impact results due to recency bias.

5. **Provide Fallback Options**: Give the model alternative paths if it cannot complete the assigned task (e.g., "respond with 'not found' if the answer is not present").

6. **Test and Iterate**: Continuously test and refine your prompts based on results.

7. **Use Examples Strategically**: Provide diverse, high-quality examples that represent the range of expected inputs.

## Execution Instructions

1. **Setup**:
   - Ensure Azure OpenAI Service is configured in your `.env` file
   - Open the **Prompt Engineering.ipynb** notebook in Azure AI Foundry or VS Code

2. **Learning Approach**:
   - Execute cells sequentially, observing examples of each technique
   - Read theoretical explanations before practical examples
   - Compare results between different approaches for similar tasks

3. **Experimentation**:
   - Experiment with modifying prompts to see how changes affect results
   - Try your own examples with each technique
   - Test edge cases and limitations

4. **Practice**:
   - Complete hands-on exercises for each technique
   - Compare effectiveness of different approaches
   - Build your own prompt library for common tasks
