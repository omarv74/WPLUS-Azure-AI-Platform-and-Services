    "1. Initialize the AI Project client\n",
    "2. List available models\n",
    "3. Create a simple chat completion request\n",
    "4. Create a basic AI agent\n",

    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- Completed environment setup from previous notebook\n",
    "- Azure credentials configured\n",
    "- **azure-ai-projects** package version 1.0.0b12 or greater (`azure-ai-projects>=1.0.0b12`)\n",
    "- **Azure AI User role** assigned to your account for the Azure AI Foundry project\n",
    "  - See [Azure AI Foundry RBAC documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/rbac-azure-ai-foundry?pivots=fdp-project) for more details on role assignments"
